    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>6 years ago I really started to notice the ammount of old cans and plastics bottles that I was simply throwing away to be put in a landfill somewhere. I recongnized the unneeded waste that I was adding to the 
			envirnoment and decided I was going to try and make a small difference. So I collected some old cans and plastic bottles and used them to create an lawn chair. I really enjoyed creating the chair,
			and found that other people admired my work. So I started making more cahirs and selling them to friends and family. I was saving so many items that would otherwise just be thrown away that I 
			make the decision to turn it into a business. Today our business takes donations of old cans and bottles and turns them into furniture for sale.
